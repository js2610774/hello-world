Assignment 1 

Hi, my name is John Spurling but I go by my middle name Andrew. 
I took a break from school from spring 2017 until fall of 2019 where
I took a couple classes at Fullerton College and now I am back here at RCC. I also take classes at OCC.
I am majoring in computer science and will transfer to a 4 year university once I complete 
my general education. I haven't taken a programming class since I was last here at RCC in 2017
so my programming skills could use a bit of work. I am hoping that if I thoroughly study the review topics
for C++ Programming and put in the extra effort early on to refresh my knowledge on these topics that I will
be successful in this class.
